        <p><h2>About Me</h2></p>

        <p>- I've successfully rescued and rehomed 3 stray dogs and 1 stray cat in my life.</p>
        <p>- I have been or travelled through all but 15 states in the U.S. so far. Never for a family road trip. I have favorites.</p>
        <p>- I used to have an irrational fear of needles. Now I just pretend that I don't anymore.</p>
        <p>- I thought in middle school that I was going to make it to the NFL. Then I saw how big the high school football players were and retired early.</p>
        <p>- I then changed course and thought that I was going to make it to the NBA. But I forgot to make the high school basketball team.</p>
