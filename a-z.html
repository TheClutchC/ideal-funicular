            <p>Welcome to my blog, <em>Show What I Know.</em></p>
            <p> I hope that this will be a useful resource in the future for others like me who are starting out. My goal is to use this as a way to strengthen my knowledge of certain concepts as well as display what I know. Perhaps I can document my learning curve with this as well and show as I struggle and grow through certain concepts and languages. Let's go!</p>
